Hi there! 

I'm an avid computer science practitioner, currently pursuing a doctoral degree focusing on solving issues at the intersection of computer architecture and high-performance computing.
 
I have previously worked in a document intelligence startup. My responsibilities included designing an in-house OCR (Optical Character Recognition) engine and developing solutions for information extraction from complex financial documents. I also interned as a Data Scientist at HID Global in Austin, TX during the summer of 2023. At HID, I worked on curating datasets and developing data pipelines for person re-identification.

Most recently, I have started working with computer architecture problems and Iâ€™m currently looking into how architectural choices affect high-performance computing. I am working under the guidance of Prof. Kanad Ghose at Binghamton University.
